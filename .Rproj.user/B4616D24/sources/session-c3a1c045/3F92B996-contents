## 2  Data

### 2.1  Population of Interest and Sample

Our analysis focuses on residents of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) who may be displaced—internally or across borders—by climate-related natural disasters.  
We assemble a balanced country–year panel covering **32 sovereign LAC countries** (listed in Appendix A) observed annually from **2008 through 2023**. The starting year is chosen because systematic disaster-displacement reporting by IDMC and asylum-flow reporting by UNHCR both stabilize after 2007, while EM-DAT event coverage remains complete.  
With 16 years for each country, the final dataset contains **512 country-year observations** (32 × 16), providing enough time-series variation to identify both short-run (sudden-onset) and lagged (slow-onset) disaster effects on migration outcomes.

```{r country-table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr); library(dplyr); library(knitr)
countries <- read_csv("data/intermediate/countries.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
kable(countries %>% arrange(country_name),
      col.names = c("ISO-3", "Country"),
      caption = "Appendix A: LAC countries included in the panel (2008–2023)")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
